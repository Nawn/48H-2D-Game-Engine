# 48H-2D-Game-Engine
Ludum Dare 37, this is my first C++ project, and first ever Game Engine written, learned C++ within 2 weeks, built the engine within 48 hours

I built this game using only [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/ "Simple Fast MultiMedia Library"). Go ahead and check them out
if you're interested. I may begin working with SDL rather than SFML. undecided. 

*Thank you*
